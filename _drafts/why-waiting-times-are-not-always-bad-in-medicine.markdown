When discussing quality of healthcare, a lot of talk goes into waiting times. Shorter waiting times are often taken as a proxy of higher quality. 

Without denying that shorter waiting time make for a better healthcare system, I think often patients discount the importance of healing time. 

Patients - me included - can misjudge the urgency or severity of their conditions and see the lack of responsiveness of the healthcare system as directly damaging to their health. Yet, often their illness or ailments simply resolve with time and without need for medical intervention. Often, patients scheduled for tests and procedures do not end up attending the scheduled appointment, because by the time the test can be arranged their symptoms have largely resolved. 

[It will be interesting to have some data on what percentage of no shows is due to this phenomenon. ]

This does not want in any way to suggest that we should make patients wait in the hope that their illnesses go away. The role of the doctor is also to reassure, and prompt tests may well help in that process. 

Delayed prescriptions work on the same principle. Reassure the patient, arm them with the tools they need to face the situation if it worsesns, but also save a lot of unnecessary prescriptions. [Data on this would be interesting]

Could the same principle of reservation without booking work for outpatient appointments, procedure and imaging studies?
