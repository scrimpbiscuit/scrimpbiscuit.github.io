UK politicians are much more eloquent than Italians

Journalists on the radio are much more assertive, never afraid of challenging

Debates are more structured, without opponents interrupting each other

Intelligence squared is a good example of these 'oxford style' debates and they are very effective ways of hashing out important issues without falling into easy retoric.
