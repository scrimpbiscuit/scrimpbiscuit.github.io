title: "Solve the airport modeling problem with data"
---

No one can predict whether an expanded Gatwick will be more useful than an expanded heathrow or whether stansted would ease more traffic.
While this can be debated at nauseam, it will ultimately come to lobbying power. Calling a vote is too expensive, but what if you could use data to make an informed decision? Imagine if the website [Kayak](www.kayak.com) were to ask every single person who is trying to book a flight from heathrow 'would you have booked a flight from stansted?' or something along these lines? Immediately you have a large data set of forecasted volumes throught the airports.


[Previous surveys](http://www.kayak.co.uk/news/staycation-over-kayak-survey-finds-people-will-travel-far-and-wide-in-2009.bd.html) have been conducted by Kayak.
