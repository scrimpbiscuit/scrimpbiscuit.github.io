Trained as a biomedical engineer, computational biologist and doctor.

Working as a data scientist at [Open Targets][], where we use machine learning and software engineering to help find new drugs, taking advantage of human genetics and other biological data.


<!--## Education 

I graduated from the [University of Toronto][] with a bachelor in [Engineering Science][]. I continued my path in biomedical engineering with a S.M. in mechanical engineering at [MIT][] and a Ph.D from the [Harvard/MIT Health Science & Technology Institute][] working on the [interface between the human immune system and the microbiome][almlab].
You can find a list of my research publications on [Google scholar][]. I have trained as a physician at [Imperial College London medical school][].-->
